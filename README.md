# RobloxStudio-Icon-Refresher
Thank you for checking out my solo texture pack. This is a all in one, you dont have to do anything after the steps below are done.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Click the green "<> Code" button on the top right of the repository (the page you are currently on)

1. Click "Download Zip"

2. In File Explorer/Finder, Extract the zip that you just downloaded

Find the "Roblox Studio Icon Refresher" inside the extracted zip

Extract that zip (i know that this is very inconsistant i apologize)

Then go to roblox studio, click file, then studio settings, then in directories, there should be a option called "Custom Icon Dir".

Click it, then click the second folder you just extracted. Restart roblox studio, and your all set!

Bye bye weird simplified icons, Hello classical!
